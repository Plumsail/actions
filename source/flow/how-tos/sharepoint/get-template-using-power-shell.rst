How to get a PnP provisioning template using PowerShell and then apply it in Microsoft Flow
============================================================================================================================

This article will show how to create a PnP template via PowerShell. As a result we'll have an XML file 
which can be used with Plumsail SharePoint connector `Provision PnP template to SharePoint`_ .

Create a SharePoint list with custom columns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
First of all you need to install SharePoint PnP library of PowerShell commands.
Microsoft provides 3 ways to install the cmdlets and you can find them in the `official MS article`_ .

The fastest way to do this is to run the command in MS PowerShell console

:code:`Install-Module SharePointPnPPowerShellOnline`


After installing the cmdlets you need to connect to your SharePoint site:

:code:`Connect-PnPOnline -Url https://mycompany.sharepoint.com/sites/mysite`

or in case of multi-factor authentication use

:code:`Connect-PnPOnline -Url https://yoursite.sharepoint.com -UseWebLogin`

Once connected we use next command to take a template from the whole site

:code:`Get-PnPProvisioningTemplate -Out path`

For example, :code:`Get-PnPProvisioningTemplate -Out C:\Temp\Template.xml`

This command creates an xml file which has the whole structure of the Sharepoint site and we

can use the file in MS flow and select it in `Provision PnP template to SharePoint`_ .

Conclusion

I also recommend you take alook at another article `How to create SharePoint list from PnP provisioning template in Microsoft Flow`_.
If you havenâ€™t used it yet, `registering an account`_ would be the first step. It is quite easy to get started.
