You can choose your billing cycle â€” purchase for one year or pay month-to-month. The subscription is linked to an email address. It includes a set of actions for Power Automate (Microsoft Flow) or Logic apps and access to REST API.

There are three plans available:

- **Dolphin** - includes 500 monthly executions

- **Whale** - includes 15 000 monthly executions

If none of the plans satisfies your requirements, drop us a message to sales@plumsail.com.

What are executions?
---------------------

We consider an execution each time an action is exectued in Power Automate (Microsoft Flow), Azure Logic Apps, PowerApps or called from REST API.

What happens when executions are spent?
---------------------------------------

You can control usage stats in your `Plumsail Actions account <https://account.plumsail.com/actions/subscription>`_.
If you see that you most likely reach the limit this month, you can purchase `additional 500 executions`_ or pay a differential cost to `start using another plan`_.

The executions amount will be reset at 1st day of a month according to your current plan.

How to upgrade or renew subscription
------------------------------------

`Subscription management`_ is available in the Plumsail account.
