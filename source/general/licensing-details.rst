What are executions?
---------------------

We consider an execution each time an action is exectued in Power Automate (Microsoft Flow), Azure Logic Apps, PowerApps or called from REST API.

What happens when credits are spent?
--------------------------------------

You can see usage stats in your Plumsail Documents account. If you see that you most likely reach the limit this month, you can purchase `additional 500 executions <https://plumsail.com/actions/store/>`_ or pay a differential cost to `start using another plan <upgrade-renew.html>`_.

The executions amount will be reset at 1st day in a month according to your current plan.
